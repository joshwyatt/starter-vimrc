# A starter vimrc

This repo's `.vimrc` is a basic, lightly opinionated vimrc that you should only use if you know what you're doing :-)

To install it (and do be aware the following command will overwrite an exisitng vimrc) run the following in the terminal:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshwyatt/starter-vimrc/master/.vimrc > ~/.vimrc
```
